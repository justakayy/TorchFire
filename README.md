# ðŸ”¥ TorchFire

A lightweight [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin for Minecraft 1.15.1 that adds a fiery twist to how torches interact with flammable blocks.

- When a **torch** is placed **under** a flammable block (e.g. wood), the block will **catch fire**.
- When a **flammable block** is placed **above** a torch, it will **immediately ignite**.
- Works out-of-the-box â€“ no configuration needed!

## ðŸ”¥ Supported Blocks
